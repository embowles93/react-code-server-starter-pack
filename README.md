# The React Code Server Starter Pack

I created this repository to make it easier to get going with a react app on code-server. In my environment, I am running code server via the one-click deployment method on AWS, and using the 'link' flag for authentication.

Specifically, this deployment requires some additional configuration of two environment variables to run properly using code-server's port forward proxy. That is the only file which differs from running 'npx create-react-app'.
